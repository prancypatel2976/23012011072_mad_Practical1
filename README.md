<br>1_2. Type Conversion: Perform type conversions such as Integer to Double, String to Integer, and String to Double.<br>

<br>1_3. Scan student’s information and display all the data: Input and display data of students, including their name, enrolment no, branch,etc.<br>
<br>Description: Takes student details (name, enrollment number, branch, etc.) as input and displays them.<br>
<br>Purpose: Introduces user input handling in Kotlin and displays structured data using string templates.<br>

<br>1_4. Check Odd or Even Numbers: Determine whether a number is odd or even using control flow within println() method.<br>
<br>Description: Checks whether a given number is odd or even using the modulus operator (%).<br>
<br>Purpose: Demonstrates conditional logic and control flow in Kotlin expressions.<br>
<img width="241" height="69" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ea88a91-9a49-4227-aa7c-4cc226793e1c" />
<br>1_5. Display Month Name: Use a when expression to display the month name based on user input.<br>
<br>Description: Displays the name of a month based on its number (1–12) using the when expression.<br>
<br>Purpose: Shows how to implement decision-making in Kotlin with the when expression, which is more powerful than traditional switch-case.<br>

<br>1_6. User-Defined Function: Create a user-defined function to perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two numbers<br>
<br>Description: Creates a user-defined function to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers.<br>
<br>Purpose: Helps understand function creation, parameter passing, and reusability in Kotlin.<br>
<img width="552" height="236" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06eab57b-c7ea-4373-9c23-212941d455e9" />
<br>1_7. Factorial Calculation with Recursion: Calculate the factorial of a number using recursion.<br>
<br>Description: Computes the factorial of a number using a recursive function.<br>
<br>Purpose: Demonstrates recursion in Kotlin and teaches the importance of base cases and recursive calls.<br>

<br>1_8. Working with Arrays: Explore array operations such as Arrays.deepToString(), contentDeepToString(), IntArray.joinToString(), and use them to print arrays. Utilize various loop types like range, downTo, until, etc., to manipulate arrays. Sort an array of integers both without using built-in functions and with built-in functions.<br>
<br>Description: Performs multiple array operations:
Printing arrays (Arrays.deepToString(), contentDeepToString(), IntArray.joinToString())
Iterating with loops (range, downTo, until)
Sorting (manually and using built-in functions)<br>
<br>Purpose: Provides complete understanding of array manipulation and traversal in Kotlin.<br>

<br>1_9. Find Maximum Number from ArrayList: Write a program to find the maximum number from an ArrayList of integers.<br>
<br>Description: Finds the maximum number in an ArrayList<Int>.<br>
<br>Purpose: Introduces Kotlin collections (ArrayList) and shows how to perform search operations.<br>
<img width="314" height="240" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75bbc6b6-86fb-4efc-86b2-c5c0819e184c" />
<br>1_10. Class and Constructor Creation: Define different classes and constructors. Create a "Car" class with properties like type, model, price, owner, and miles driven. Implement functions to get car information, original car price, current car price, and display car information<br>
<br>Description: Defines a Car class with properties (type, model, price, owner, miles driven) and functions to calculate/display car details.<br>
<br>Purpose: Explains object-oriented programming (OOP) in Kotlin including classes, constructors, and member functions.<br>
